# Transit Optimiser
## Transit Optimiser
Transit Optimiser is a simulation project where a landmass is generated, populated and simulated to generate optimal transit routes. Generation is entirely procedural, designing the world entirely procedurally causes randomness, which is not desired when the goal is to test and compare different parameters on otherwise identical environmental parameters including location, settlements and residents of those settlements, therefore we used generation using seeds. If required, user can generate different sandboxes with same seeds and change only the parameters required to be compared, hence by using seeds, different parameters can be tested on exactly identical set of sandboxes.
